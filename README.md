# Jungle - An E-Commerce Experience!

Introducing Jungle, the e-commerce website that brings the shopping experience to a whole new level. Built using Ruby on Rails, Cypress, RSpec, and SCSS, Jungle offers a fast, secure, and engaging platform for shopping online.

Jungle is equipped with secure Stripe payments, giving customers the ability to make purchases with confidence. The integration of gems such as money-rails and bcrypt further enhances the security of the platform, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected.

Jungle offers customers the flexibility to checkout as a guest or create an account for a more personalized experience.

For the administrators, Jungle has an exclusive dashboard that is only accessible with the admin login. This dashboard allows administrators to manage and update items and launch sales.

In short, Jungle is a simple and high-quality e-commerce platform that provides a seamless and engaging shopping experience for customers and a powerful set of tools for administrators.
