# Jungle - An E-Commerce Experience!

Introducing Jungle, the e-commerce website that brings the shopping experience to a whole new level. Built using Ruby on Rails, Cypress, RSpec, and SCSS, Jungle offers a fast, secure, and engaging platform for shopping online.

Jungle is equipped with secure Stripe payments, giving customers the ability to make purchases with confidence. The integration of gems such as money-rails and bcrypt further enhances the security of the platform, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected.
